 * google search packagename cran OR r-project -inurl:contrib -inurl:doc/packages

 * references
 * books
 * websites

* related packages: by author, by topic

* ratings display in aggregate, and individually
* timeline of packages releases, average time between etc

* rss streams events

Version ----------

* easy access to changelogs (both human and computer generated - e.g.
cranberries), news, etc.

User -------------

* since the package description usually contains the email addresses of maintainers and contributers, it should be easy to associate these with users (and then display comments left by package owners in a different style)

* http://site.gravatar.com/

* list of packages, comments, tags

* rss streams events

Rating -----------

* use hreview microformat http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview

Distant future ==================

* messages from the mailing lists (r-help, and announcements)
* documentation
* lists of papers that cite that package (relatively difficult with
current bibliographic data sources, but hopefully will be easier in
the future) - scripted google scholar search
