Welcome to the new development blog for [crantastic.org](http://crantastic.org)!
My name is Bjørn Arild Mæland and I'm one of the R Foundation's lucky [GSoC](http://code.google.com/soc)
students for 2009. I will work full-time on expanding and improving crantastic
for the duration of the summer. The full project details can be viewed
[here](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/rf/t124024721494). This
blog will be used to document the development progress &ndash; hope you'll
follow along! For smaller updates you can also follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Chrononaut).

I'd also like to use this opportunity to thank my mentor Hadley Wickhan and the
R Foundation for the warm welcome, it's great to do GSoC with you!
