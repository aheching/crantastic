  # About us

  Crantastic is a free open source web-application, written in [ruby on
  rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). The full source code is available from our
  [GitHub repository](http://github.com/hadley/crantastic/tree/master), so
  anyone can follow the development. This also means that if there's a
  specific feature you'd like to see implemented, you can actually help coding
  it yourself.

  Crantastic was created by [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/). It is one of
  the [R Foundation](http://www.r-project.org/foundation/main.html)'s four
  [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) projects for 2009. The
  work is being carried out by [Bjørn Mæland](http://chrononaut.net/).

  ## Tracking progress

  If you want to keep track of what's happening with crantastic, you can read
  our [development blog](http://blog.crantastic.org/), which we use to inform
  about and document the GSoC project progress.

  ## Problems or suggestions?

  We have an [issue tracker](http://github.com/hadley/crantastic/issues) for
  keeping track of technical issues. If you run into any problems or bugs,
  please submit them here. Additionally we have an [account on
  UserVoice](http://crantastic.uservoice.com/) where we collect ideas for new
  features. Be sure to add your idea to the list!
