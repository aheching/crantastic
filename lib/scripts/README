Scripts that reside on the Crantastic VPS, triggered by various cron tasks:

NOTE: It's important to note that the crantastic app uses UTC, so the times for
the tweet.sh and weekly.sh cronjobs has to be adjusted if the server clock is in
a different timezone. E.g. if the server is on EDT, the hour has to be adjusted
to 19 (EDT is 4 hours behind UTC).
